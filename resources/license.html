<h4>Mod Packs</h4>

<p>I am a fan of mod packs and have no problem with the mod jar files being included in mod packs. In general and specifically to mod packs, follow the license and you can do what you wish with my mods.</p>

<ul>

<li>NonCommercial: These mods are free, don't charge money for them.</li>
